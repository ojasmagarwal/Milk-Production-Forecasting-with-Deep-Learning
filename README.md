# Milk-Production-Forecasting-with-Deep-Learning

->  Trained an LSTM‑based deep learning model, achieving a 95% accuracy rate in predicting monthly milk production.
->  Leveraged Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to build the system using time‑series data.
->  Utilized techniques such as feature selection and model tuning to ensure top‑notch performance.
->  Proposed method can enable a dairy production company to optimize their forecasting and planning process.
